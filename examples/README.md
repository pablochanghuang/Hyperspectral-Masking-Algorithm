Notebooks .ipynb Files that properly import code from source and show data examples of how to use the hyperspectral masking and mineral characterization algorithms. 

Files:
* CNN_masker.ipynb: Creates a CNN model for masking given an image size.
* Distribution Model.ipynb:
* exploratory_analysis.ipynb: Plots and compares the average absorbance sample 620 with one sample from crate.
* hyperspectral_classifier.ipynb: Create and test a Classifier to predict the minerals on hyperspectral image.
* masking.ipynb: Masking image preprocessing tool for the hyperspectral "crate" data. Classifies cluster of rocks to train a model to differentiate data from background. Saves a binary file of a trained masking model. 
* masking-Copy1.ipynb: Copy of masking.ipynb 
* multiple_input_model.ipynb: Apply the thin-section SVM classifier model (that was trained using automated-mineralogy) to the new crate data in two steps process: interpolatation and regression.

How to run:
