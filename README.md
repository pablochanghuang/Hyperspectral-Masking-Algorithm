# Hyperspectral-Masking-Algorithm
Machine Learning Algorithm to automate the construction of masks, which are otherwise hand-drawn by visual inspection of the images obtained from the drill core boxes;. Exclude data from: Core Box, Wooden blocks (Indicate drill depth) Broken Material (too fine-grained for good reflectance)
